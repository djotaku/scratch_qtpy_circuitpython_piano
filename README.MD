# MIT Scratch and Adafruit QTPy Piano

Based on the example from a recent Circuit Python newsletter.

The Scratch project contains a piano that plays based on keyboard presses.

Then the CircuitPython code on the Adafruit [QTPy](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600) uses Adafruit's HID code to push those same keyboard keys when the capacitive touch pins are activated.

Here's a video of it in action:
